# Admin Job Posting Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a new feature that allows administrators to post job opportunities on behalf of companies. This feature was added to the admin panel under "Job Management" with the tab name "Admin Job Post".

## Features Implemented

### 1. New Admin Sidebar Tab

- Added "Admin Job Post" as the first item under "Job Management" in `AdminSidebar.tsx`
- Available to all admins (not just superadmins)

### 2. Admin Job Post Form (`AdminJobPostTab.tsx`)

**Company Selection:**

- Dropdown with all verified companies from the database
- "Other" option for manual company entry
- When "Other" is selected, shows additional input field for custom company name

**Additional Fields:**

- Company Website (optional)
- Original Advertisement Link (optional)
- These links are automatically appended to the job description

**Job Form:**

- Same structure as company job posting form
- All existing fields: title, description, job type, category, location, etc.
- Qualified degrees selection (multi-select checkboxes)
- Skills required (dynamic tag system)
- Salary range (optional)

### 3. API Endpoint (`/api/admin/job/create`)

**Features:**

- Admin authentication required
- Validates either `companyId` (for registered companies) or `customCompanyName` (for manual entry)
- Enhances job description with company website and original ad links
- Creates job with admin metadata (admin ID, username, posted by admin flag)

**Email Notification:**

- `adminId` (ObjectId, optional) - reference to admin who posted
- `adminUsername` (String, optional) - admin username for easy identification

**Model Changes:**

- Made `companyId` optional (was required)
- Added pre-save validation to ensure either `companyId` or `customCompanyName` is provided

### 5. Authentication Updates

**Enhanced Admin JWT:**
